# Complex Trait Genomic Analysis Course

### Complex Trait Genomic Analysis is complex and there are no simple answers to complex issues. You are usually forced to remain in the probability grey area when making inferences. This does not mean you cannot make any assertion nor gain any knowledge, simply that assertions do narrow your ignorance but they do not remove it.

Most of the genes that are of socioeconomic importance, e.g., genes affecting disease susceptibility or that makes Iberian pig meat taste good, are very difficult to find because they are influenced by many genes of small effect. The notes here deal with concepts and statistical and computational tools that help us to identify these genes. A topic of particular interest is combining different sources of molecular information, including complete genome sequence, to predict genetic merit.

First, please browse the [overview](https://github.com/miguelperezenciso/CTGAcourse/blob/master/Overview.pdf) slides.

So far, the course is organized as follows:

- [Background](https://github.com/miguelperezenciso/CTGAcourse/tree/master/Chapter1_Background)
- [Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS](https://github.com/miguelperezenciso/CTGAcourse/tree/master/Chapter2_GWAS)
- [Genomic Prediction](https://github.com/miguelperezenciso/CTGAcourse/tree/master/Chapter3_GS)
- [Next Generation Sequence data analysis](https://github.com/miguelperezenciso/CTGAcourse/tree/master/Chapter4_NGS)
- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/miguelperezenciso/CTGAcourse/tree/master/Chapter5_ML)

Not all chapters are equally well developed, especially the machine learning one. Machine Learning in genomics will be fully developed in future independent notes.

This course was first taught in wonderful Salvador de Bahia in November 2018 thanks to my good friend and former student Luis Fernando Batista, from [UFBA](https://www.ufba.br/).

### These notes are somewhat incomplete but will be improving in the very near future.
