# Complex Trait Genomic Analysis Course

Most of the genes that are of socioeconomic importance, e.g., genes affecting disease susceptibility or that makes Iberian pig meat taste good, are very difficult to find because they are influenced by many genes of small effect. The notes here deal with concepts and statistical and computational tools that help us to identify these genes. A topic of particular interest is combining different sources of molecular information, including complete genome sequence, to predict genetic merit.

So far, the course is organized as follows:

- Background
- Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
- Genomic Prediction
- Next Generation Sequence data analysis
- Machine Learning

Not all chapters are equally well developed, especially the machine learning one. Machine Learning in genomics will be fully developed in a future independent notes.

This course was first taught in wonderful Salvador de Bahia in November 2018 thanks to my good friend and former student Luis Fernando Batista, from UFBA.

### NOTE: These notes are quite incomplete but I will work on those in the very near future.
